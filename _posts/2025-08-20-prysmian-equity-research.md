In this research project, I conducted a full **equity valuation of Prysmian S.p.A.**, a global leader in energy and telecom cable systems.  
The report forms part of my Masterâ€™s thesis at Nova SBE, where I combined rigorous financial modeling with a strategic view of the industry.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights
- **DCF valuation** with segment-level forecasts (2025â€“2032)  
- **Monte Carlo simulation** to capture valuation uncertainty  
- **WACC of 8.18%** and cost of equity at 9.32%  
- **Terminal value** modeled via ROIC Ã— reinvestment rate  
- FX sensitivity analysis, given ~35% USD-denominated revenue  
- Relative valuation via APV, EVA, and FTE cross-checks  

### ðŸ“Œ Takeaways
The model pointed to a **fair value range between â‚¬71â€“76/share**, with upside driven by Prysmianâ€™s transmission backlog, electrification tailwinds, and acquisitions (Encore Wire & Channell).  
Key risks include FX volatility, commodity pricing, and execution on the transmission pipeline.
